# Changelog

## 0.7.1
- Dashboard cards: if the `www` folder did not exist yet, Home Assistant only serves it after a restart. PrintDock now detects this, offers a "Restart Home Assistant" button and confirms once the cards are available
- Card setup status visible under *Settings → Home Assistant* (set up, restart needed, YAML mode with ready-to-paste lines, error)
- Works with both `/homeassistant` and `/config` mounts

## 0.7.0
- **PrintDock cards for Home Assistant dashboards** (`custom:printdock-card`, `custom:printdock-overview-card`)
  - Printer card: status light, job with progress and layers, camera, temperatures, fans, filament slots, light, speed, pause/resume/stop, "plate is clear", power on/off
  - Overview card: status counts, all printers, queue, orders, low spools and due maintenance – sections selectable, list length adjustable
  - Visual editor, German and English, follows the Home Assistant theme
- Installed automatically with the add-on; otherwise one click under *Settings → Home Assistant* or via HACS (Dashboard repository)
- New MQTT sensor "PrintDock overview" with all data for the overview card

## 0.6.2
- Light on Klipper printers detected automatically (LED/output_pin, Moonraker power device or LIGHT_ON/OFF macros)
